## 📂 Projects

### 🗄️ Worlds Simplest Db

**[Worlds Simplest Db](https://github.com/SBortz/worlds-simplest-db)** – An educational journey through database evolution, demonstrating how databases work under the hood. Four progressively optimized versions (V1: text-based append-only, V2: binary format, V3: in-memory index, V4: SSTable-based LSM-tree) showcase the fundamental trade-offs between write and read performance, from O(1) writes with O(n) reads to modern architectures used in LevelDB and RocksDB. 

### 📚 Event Sourcing Sample

**[Event Sourcing Sample](https://github.com/SBortz/understanding-eventsourcing-dotnet)** – An exploration of different approaches to implementing the Event Model from Martin Dilger's book "Understanding Event Sourcing" using .NET. Comparative study showcasing multiple implementation approaches including Event Sourcing with Aggregate and the Decider Model.

### 🚂 Abfahrtsmonitor.ch

**[Abfahrtsmonitor.ch](https://abfahrtsmonitor.ch)** – Live departure monitor for stops and stations in Switzerland, similar to the large departure boards at train stations. 

### 🧪 .NET Training

**[.NET Training](https://github.com/SBortz/dotnet-training)** – A collection of .NET training examples and experiments exploring fundamental C# concepts. Includes practical examples covering equality comparison (`==`, `.Equals()`, `ReferenceEquals()`), binary operations, collections, sorting, and memory management, demonstrating the nuances and behaviors of different .NET types and patterns.
